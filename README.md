This projects pulls data from the ChEMBL database in order to create a linear regression model of Histamine H3 agonists/inverse agonists.
* **Python libraries used:** Pandas, numpy, rdkit, Seaborn, padelpy, matplotlib, sklearn
* **Input:** ChEMBL canonical smiles notation and IC50 values
* **Output:** QSAR model of Histamine H3 agonists/inverse agonists
