This projects pulls data from the ChEMBL database in order to create a QSAR model of glucagon-like peptide 1 agonists/inverse agonists.
* **Python libraries used:** Pandas, numpy, rdkit, Seaborn, padelpy, matplotlib, sklearn
* **Input:** ChEMBL canonical smiles notation and IC50 values
* **Output:** Linear Regression model of glucagon-like peptide 1 agonists/inverse agonists

* Team statistics web-scraped from www.NBA.com 
* Exploratory data analysis and visualization of the win percentage of teams, when playing at their home stadium versus opponentâ€™s stadium
* Discovered that on average, teams win 35% more games when playing in their own stadium
